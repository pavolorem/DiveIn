# Getting Started

Snyk Code https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/uses a revolutionary approach designed to be developer-first. Conventional Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are limited by lengthy scans times and poor accuracy, returning too many false positives, and eroding developer trust. Snyk Code makes developer efforts efficient and actionable.
